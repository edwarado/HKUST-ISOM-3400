# HKUST-ISOM-3400
The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology ISOM3400 Project

The problem of the project is regarding the characteristics of top 250 universities around the world. The board of directors may want to improve their university ranking. They may wonder what factors are correlated with the university ranking. In this project, the percentage of international students, number of students per staff and number of
students are examined. The board of directors may want to improve the university ranking by making different policy decisions. University ranking offers a shorthand list of
universities which provide prospective students with some information for looking for a decent university. A higher university ranking may attract more talented students to pursue their higher education in that university.
